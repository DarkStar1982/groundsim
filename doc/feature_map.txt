*** TODO ***
- Fix save behaviour
- Add complete eventlog functionality
- Add uplink/downlink functions (later)
- ground station related features (later)
- Add simulation features, as following:
  = sun vector, beta angle?
  = satellite geometry
  = inbound thermal balance calculation
  = inbound solar power calculation
  = electrical power subsystem
  = total thermal balance calculation
  = attitude determination and control

- Implement SDR simulation
- Implemenent data exchange simulation between subsystems

*** DONE ***
20/12/2020
- Add example mission with objectives
- Add mission scenario functionality
- Add eventlog table
- Improve accuracy of mission simulation
- Add simulation features, as following:
= payload instruments, day/night cycle
- Port code to use Skyfield library
- Do full mission simulation test
= Foundd more efficient data structure for SpliceVM program memory
= Switched execution from continous to step mode

13/01/2021
- Implemented OBDH subsystem VM

26/01/2021
- onboard computer with SPLICE interpreter, note:
  = Implement all opcodes and correct scheduler behaviour
  = Implement NMF pass-through functionality equivalent
- Add "update TLE" command
- Implement GPS simulation
